# Product Requirements Document (PRD) - Case Study: “MoodBudget” a finance management and budgeting app


## **Introduction**

### **Background**

The MoodBudget finance management and budgeting app is the focus of this PRD which has been developed as part of the EntryLevel Product Management Level 2 course. This individual project required the selection of a single product from four hypothetical project briefs. I chose this project to diversify my product management portfolio.

### **Product Overview**

This Product Requirements Document (PRD) is intended to outline the development of a new personal finance management and budgeting app called MoodBudget. The app is designed to help users track their spending, create and stick to a budget, and make informed financial decisions.

The development of MoodBudget is driven by user's goals of improving financial health, increasing financial literacy, making informed financial decisions, and sticking to a budget.

### Your Role:

As the Product Manager and Product Designer, my responsibilities included developing the Product Requirements Document (PRD), designing the user interface and user experience (UI/UX), and overseeing the conceptualization and planning phases of the HolistiqCare app. This document showcases my work in creating the PRD and design specifications for the app.

### Design Process:

Iterative design approach with feedback loops from potential users to refine UI/UX, this included adopting User-Centered Design approach, developing low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes and testing them with users. 

## Testing and Validation

### Testing Strategy:

A comprehensive testing strategy was developed to ensure the app’s functionality and user experience. This included:

- **Usability Testing:** Conducted with a small group of users to identify and fix usability issues.

### Results:

- Initial feedback highlighted areas for improvement in the location of key features, these issues were addressed promptly and tested with users for validation.

## **Product launch strategy and Implementation**

**Launch Strategy**: Alpha/Beta/General Availability releases

This launch strategy involves releasing the product in stages to gather feedback from customers and make changes before the full release. For MoodBudget app, we can start with an alpha release to a small group of beta testers who can provide valuable feedback on the app's functionality and user experience. We can then make necessary changes before launching a beta release to a larger group of users. The insights gathered from the beta release can help us refine the app further before launching the general availability release to the public.

This strategy is a good fit for MoodBudget because it allows us to get feedback from early adopters and make necessary changes before the full release. Additionally, it will allow us to engage with customers and create a sense of exclusivity among early adopters. However, we will need to find customers to start with, and it may take a longer time to launch the full version.
